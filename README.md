💡 Key Findings & Insights
📌 R&D Investment has the highest positive impact on profit

Higher R&D expenditure leads to:
✔ Better innovation
✔ Product differentiation
✔ Long-term sustainable returns

👉 Startups investing more in R&D tend to be more profitable
📌 Marketing Spend shows moderate positive impact

Marketing improves profit when:
✔ Supported by strong product development
✔ Targeted toward right customer base
But excess marketing without product value gives weak ROI

📌 Administration Cost has minimal or no impact on profit High admin expenses do not guarantee growth.

Recommendation:
➡ Improve operational efficiency
➡ Reduce overhead costs

🧭 Business Recommendations
